# Three basic ways to represent graph in memory
# 1) matrix
# 2) object and pointer
# 3) adjacent list
# 
# Matrix
# memory so large M*N
# random access of i to j fast
#
# Object and Pointer
# memory smaller than matrix, custom data setting good
#
# Adjacent list
# memory smaller than Object and pointer, simplest
